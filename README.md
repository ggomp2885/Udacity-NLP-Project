# Plagiarism Project, Machine Learning Deployment
## Project Overview
In this project I build a Classification Model which uses NLP preprocessing techniques for detecting the level of plagarism in newly submitted documents. I use 3 notebooks to accomplish this task, separated by the steps. Notebook 1 explores the data and its distribution, Notebook 2 is for the text preprocessing techniques, Notebook 3 contains the code for training the SKLearn model. Comments are included in each of the notebooks to explain each step as it is run.  This project is also built to be fully deployable for production use in a web app!
